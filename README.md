## Concept

<br>

<p>This project is to fulfil the requirements of the Capstone project with CodeInstitute.</p>
<p>The idea for the project is to provide a space for research and interaction for site users who have an interest in the history of England.</p>
<p>By selecting the monasteries as a defined list of items, and encouraging users to add information to the database, the project aims to achieve the CRUD features of this full stack web application</p>
